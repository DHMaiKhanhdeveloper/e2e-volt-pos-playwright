## Overview

This is the **PO spec document** for the QR Payment Q2 feature. In the proposed Linear refactor, this is where Loan (PO) would write requirements that span multiple repos.

Authors of this kind of document: **Loan (PO)** — supported by Tien for clarifications.

## 1. Background

Customers currently pay by cash or card. We want to enable **QR-based payments** (VietQR / MoMo / ZaloPay scan-to-pay) at point of sale.

## 2. User Stories

### Cashier (POS app)

* As a cashier, I want to display a QR code on the customer-facing screen so customers can scan and pay.
* As a cashier, I want to see real-time confirmation when payment is received.

### Customer

* As a customer, I want to scan a single QR and choose my payment app.

### Merchant Admin (Portal)

* As a merchant admin, I want to enable/disable QR payment for my store.
* As a merchant admin, I want to configure which QR providers to accept.

## 3. Scope by Squad

| Squad | Repo | Work |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **BE** (Trịnh) | `volt-pos-api` | New endpoints: `POST /payments/qr/generate`, webhook `/payments/qr/callback`. DB schema for QR transactions. |
| **FE POS** (Việt) | `volt-pos` | QR display screen, polling for payment confirmation, success/fail UI. |
| **FE Portal** (Thơm) | `fastboy-portal` | Settings page: toggle QR payment per store, select QR providers. |
| **QC** (Hưng) | — | Test end-to-end across 3 repos. |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cashier can generate QR for any order amount
- [ ] Payment confirmation appears within 5 seconds of customer scan
- [ ] Merchant admin can toggle QR per store, settings persist
- [ ] All 3 QR providers tested end-to-end
- [ ] Failed payments show clear error to cashier

## 5. Out of Scope

* Refund flow for QR payments (Q3)
* Multi-currency support (Q3)

## How this Document fits the refactor

* **This document lives in the Initiative**, not in any project.
* All 3 squad leads can read it without subscribing to other squads' projects.
* When the spec is ready, leads break it into issues in their respective projects (linked below as VP-1241, VP-1242, VP-1243).
* This Document is the **single source of truth** for the feature — when scope changes, update here.
